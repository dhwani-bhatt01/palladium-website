				Notice Concerning Data Transfers to the USA
			</h2>
			<p className="mt-5">
				This website may use Google Maps for embedding maps and Google Invisible
				reCAPTCHA for protection against bots and spam, YouTube to embed videos
				and Google Analytics to analyze user behavior. These services of the
				American Google LLC use cookies, among other things, and as a result,
				data is transferred to Google in the USA, whereby we assume that in this
				context no personal tracking takes place solely by using our website.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-5">
				Google is committed to ensuring an appropriate level of data protection
				in accordance with the American-European and the American-Swiss Privacy
				Shield. Further information can be found in the Google Privacy Policy.

				allows us to verify that you are the owner of the provided e-mail
				address and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will

				address) is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored
				there. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics
				has been extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp(); ” in order to ensure
				an anonymized recording of IP addresses (so-called IP-Masking). If
				anonymization is active, Google will shorten IP addresses within member
				states of the European Union or other states that belong to the European
				Economic Area. This prevents drawing conclusions about your identity.
				Only in exceptional cases the full IP address is first transferred to a
				Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google observes the data
				protection regulations of the “Privacy Shield” agreement and is
				registered with the “Privacy Shield program of the US Department of
				Commerce.
